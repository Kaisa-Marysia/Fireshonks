Set start and end paramater in the url to set the delay when the slide show in and after which time it should slide out.

https://example.com/index.html?start=1000&end=5000
This will slide the banner after one second into the screen and after five seconds out.
Please note, that the end time starts count at 0, so if you use `start=1000` and `end=5000` the slider will stand still for four seconds.
