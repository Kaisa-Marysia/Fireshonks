Set start and end paramater in the url to set the delay when the slide show in and after which time it should slide out.

https://example.com/index.html?start=1000&end=5000&day=2&track=3
This will slide the banner after one second into the screen and after five seconds out.
Please note, that the end time starts count at 0, so if you use `start=1000` and `end=5000` the slider will stand still for three seconds (1000ms for the start delay, ca 1100ms for the slide in and slide back at 5000ms). Also you need to set the `day=` `[0]`-`[4]` and the `track=` number of the day, also `[0]` - `[N]`, as in the example above.

If you want to use a other json file for the lower third information, you must edit the source url at line `57` and `64`
```javascript
 56     [...]
 57     $.getJSON('https://pretalx.c3voc.de/fire-shonks-2022/schedule/export/schedule.json', function(data) {
 58
 59     var text = `${data.schedule.conference.days[params2.getAll('day')].rooms["Fireshonks-Stream"][params2.getAll('track')].title}`
 60
 61     $(".title").html(text);
 62     });
 63     [...]
 ```
 
 At line `59` and at line `66` are configured which key value you want to parse. 
 
 `schedule.conference.days[params2.getAll('day')].rooms["Fireshonks-Stream"][params2.getAll('track')].title`
 
 ```json
 {
   "schedule": {
     ...
     "conference": {
     "days": [0-N]
       {
         "rooms": {
           "Fireshonks-Stream": [
             {
             ...
             "title": "Value",
             "persons": [0-N]
               {
                 "public_name": "VALUE",
                 ...
               }
             }],
         }
       }
     }
   }
```
